<h2>1 Preface</h2>
<p>Obtaining reliable paleointensity estimates is an important endeavor for understanding the behaviour of the geomagnetic field, but even after almost 70 years of experimentation, it still remains
one of the most challenging aspects of modern paleomagnetism. The problems and pitfalls of paleointensity studies are well documented in the literature and great efforts have been made to solve
or circumvent many of these issues. One of main tools in achieving this, is a suite of statistics that we can use to quantify and select what we believe to be the most reliable data.
Sadly, it is all too common, even in the modern literature, to find ambiguous descriptions of selection statistics and procedures, or situations where statistics are inconsistently calculated
between different studies. Therefore, in an effort to promote consistency in data analysis and reporting, when have compiled the Standard Paleointensity Definitions (SPD), which presents an
extensive list of detailed textual and mathematical definitions for paleointensity statistics to aid analysts. SPD not only lists these statistics, but provides numerical and computational advice on
how to appropriately and efficient analyze paleointensity data.</p>

<p>SPD is intended to be a useful reference document for the paleomagnetic community and we hope that the community will take up on SPD and contribute to its development. If readers have
comments, suggestions, corrections, or criticisms, we warmly invite them to contact us as we would appreciate all input that can help to further improve our ability to consistently select reliable
paleointensity data. Maintenance and updating of SPD, however, is our responsibility and we are accountable for any mistakes and omissions (particularly GAP!). The latest and legacy versions of
SPD are available from the <a href="downloads.html"style="color:blue">downloads</a> page.

<p>We are also pleased to announce that SPD is now an integral part of <a href="https://paleointensity.org/" style="color:blue" target="_blank">paleointensity.org</a>, which is a highly flexible application to analyze paleointensity data produced by different methods and experiments. This easy to use website can handle wide range of data formats and is completely FAIR data compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), easily allowing your data to be shared or made available through community databases (such as <a href="https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC" style="color:blue" target="_blank">MagIC</a>). More info can be gotten from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008791" style="color:blue" target="_blank">Beguin et al. (2020; G-Cubed, doi: 10.1029/2019GC008791)<a>.

<p>If you do use SPD or in your work (or software that uses SPD), please make it clear what version was used. For example, by stating "paleointensity statistics were calculated following the Standard Paleointensity Definitions v1.1" or "paleointensity data were analyzed using software X (citing the appropriate reference), which follows the conventions laid out by the Standard Paleointensity Definitions v1.1". We would also be grateful if you cited the publication that introduced the SPD: Paterson, G. A., L. Tauxe, A. J. Biggin, A. J., R. Shaar, and L. C. Jonestrask (2014), On improving the selection of Thellier-type paleointensity data, <i>Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst.</i>, doi: 10.1002/2013GC005135.</p>

<p>Lastly, throughout our work we have benefited from the ideas and discussions from countless others. All of these have helped to shape SPD in ways both small and large. We want to thank Julie Bowles, 
Fabio Donadini, Roman Leonhardt, Adrian Muxworthy, Peter Selkin, Hidefumi Tanaka, and Yuhji Yamamoto for their generosity 
in providing data.</p>
